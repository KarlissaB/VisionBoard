      <p>Hello! This is my vision board which includes many goals that I want to pursue in future! After I graduate from Georgia State, I would like to pursue a Master's degree in cybersecurity. I plan to work on gaining certifications so that I could enter a cross-functional area between software development and cybersecurity. Currently, my long-term career goal is to become an application security engineer. Outside of my career aspirations, I would love to make time to explore some of my personal interests like learning new instruments, cooking, knitting, and more! ðŸ™‚</p>

I often battle imposter syndrome, and while I understand that it is something that I should not acknowledge, sometimes it can be challenging for me to do. Her words encourage me to keep pursuing my aspirations below!</p>
